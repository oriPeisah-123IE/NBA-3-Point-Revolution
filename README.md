# 🏀 The NBA 3-Point Revolution (1997-2017)

## Overview
This project explores the dramatic shift in NBA basketball strategy over two decades. Using a historical dataset, I analyzed how 3-point shooting transformed from a specialist tool into a league-wide standard.

## Key Insights
* **Volume vs. Accuracy:** While the number of 3-point attempts per player skyrocketed, shooting accuracy remained remarkably stable, proving players became more skilled at high-volume shooting.
* **The "Stretch-Big" Evolution:** Positional analysis revealed that Power Forwards and Centers showed the most significant improvement in accuracy, fundamentally changing their role on the court.
* **Elite Performers:** Identified the top 10 most accurate shooters of the era, led by Stephen Curry with a career-defining 44% accuracy.
