# 🏀 The NBA 3-Point Revolution (1997-2017)

 ## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of how the 3-point shot transformed the NBA over two decades. By exploring a historical dataset of player statistics, I analyzed the shift in offensive strategies, the evolution of player roles, and the relationship between shooting volume and efficiency.
The study was conducted using a robust dataset consisting of 24,691 rows and 53 columns, covering extensive player statistics across multiple eras.


## The Mission
The primary goal was to investigate the correlation between the exponential growth in 3-point attempts and league-wide shooting accuracy. Specifically, the project examines:

 * **The Volume-Efficiency Balance**: Did the massive surge in attempts lead to a decline in accuracy, or did players' skills evolve to meet the demand?

* **Positional Impact**: How did the revolution affect specific positions? A key focus of this analysis is the transformation of "Big Men" (Power Forwards and Centers) from interior scorers to modern perimeter threats.



## Key Insights
* **Volume vs. Accuracy:** While the number of 3-point attempts per player skyrocketed, shooting accuracy remained remarkably stable, proving players became more skilled at high-volume shooting.
  
* **The "Stretch-Big" Evolution:** Positional analysis revealed that Power Forwards and Centers showed the most significant improvement in accuracy, fundamentally changing their role on the court.

* **Elite Performers & Legacy**
This analysis identifies the top 10 most accurate shooters of the era, led by Stephen Curry with a career-defining 44% accuracy.
 **It is evident that these players fundamentally changed the game's approach to 3-pointers.
   their evolution represents a major milestone in the history of basketball theory and strategic play.**
