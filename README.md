# 🏀 The NBA 3-Point Revolution (1997-2017)

 ### **Project Overview**
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of how the 3-point shot transformed the NBA over two decades. The study was conducted using a robust dataset consisting of **24,691 rows and 53 columns**, covering extensive player statistics across multiple eras.

To extract meaningful insights, **I personally managed the entire data lifecycle**, including:
* **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** I cleaned the raw dataset by handling missing values, removing noise, and ensuring data integrity across 20 seasons of statistics.
* **Advanced Data Processing:** I processed and transformed the data to calculate key performance metrics, such as seasonal averages and positional accuracy trends.
* **Statistical Analysis:** I analyzed the shift in offensive strategies and player roles, focusing on the relationship between shooting volume and efficiency.

## The Mission
The primary goal was to investigate the correlation between the exponential growth in 3-point attempts and league-wide shooting accuracy. Specifically, the project examines:

 * **The Volume-Efficiency Balance**: Did the massive surge in attempts lead to a decline in accuracy, or did players' skills evolve to meet the demand?

* **Positional Impact**: How did the revolution affect specific positions? A key focus of this analysis is the transformation of "Big Men" (Power Forwards and Centers) from interior scorers to modern perimeter threats.



## Key Insights
* **Volume vs. Accuracy:** While the number of 3-point attempts per player skyrocketed, shooting accuracy remained remarkably stable, proving players became more skilled at high-volume shooting.
  
* **The "Stretch-Big" Evolution:** Positional analysis revealed that Power Forwards and Centers showed the most significant improvement in accuracy, fundamentally changing their role on the court.

* **Elite Performers & Legacy:**
This analysis identifies the top 10 most accurate shooters of the era, led by Stephen Curry with a career-defining 44% accuracy.
 **It is evident that these players fundamentally changed the game's approach to 3-pointers.
   their evolution represents a major milestone in the history of basketball theory and strategic play.**

## Visualizations

### 1. Average 3-Point Attempts
*Annual growth of 3-point attempts per player, showing the steady rise in long-range shooting.*

**This visualization highlights the relentless expansion of the 3-point shot. 
Beyond the 1999 lockout anomaly, we see a consistent rise in volume, specifically accelerating after 2012.
This trend confirms that the "3-point revolution" is a league-wide strategic transformation, not just a passing phase.**




### 2. Average 3-Point Accuracy
*Tracking league-wide shooting percentage, demonstrating improved efficiency over two decades.*

**This graph dispels the myth that higher volume leads to lower quality.
Despite the massive increase in attempts, NBA players significantly improved their shooting efficiency, reaching a league-wide accuracy peak by 2017.
This indicates a fundamental evolution in player training and offensive decision-making.**

### 4. Positional Evolution
*Comparison of 3PT% by position, highlighting the massive leap in accuracy for Power Forwards and Centers.*

**This chart visualizes the true "revolution." 
While Guards (PG/SG) have always been efficient shooters, the most significant leap occurred among Big Men.
Between 2007 and 2017, Power Forwards and Centers nearly doubled their effectiveness from deep, reflecting the modern NBA strategy of floor spacing and the rise of the "Stretch-Big".**
